__This project aims to create a simple memory game using JavaScript. The memory game is based on matching the same cards that are shown randomly on the screen. The player selects two cards at a time and if they are the same, they stay open, otherwise they close again. The playerâ€™s goal is to match all the cards with the least moves and time.__
